                        <p style="background: rgb(208,238,255);padding: 10px;text-align: justify;">If you Oil Pressure Indicator is on, it is possible that your engine does not have enough oil in it. Engine oil should be changed 3-6 months or between 3,000 to 5,000 miles (depends on the quality of oil used). Check your oil level first using the dip stick on your engine bay, if the oil level is below the dots of the stick, we are sure that your engine needs to change its oil. Remember to use the quality of oil needed for your car as stated to your user's manual. Changing it's viscosity might not be good to your engine. If ever your oil and oil filter has been changed and the oil indicator light is still visible, let the mechanic check your air filter if it is clogged or there is too much dirt in it. If it is still new and usable, your mechanic just need to remove the dirt on the air filter by using vacuum or air spray. If the light is still on, let your mechanic finally check if your oil gauge is faulty or not. After all has been checked and your indicator is working properly, there might be a small chance that your car has engine wear due to misuse or not maintaining your oil properly which can case to reducing oil pressure in your engine. To avoid it, make sure to have your engine oil and oil filter changed regularly at a proper period and proper way and don't stay too long at a lower gear at high rpm range as it can cause a lot of wear and overheating on your engine. </p>
